**Tic Tac Toe Game**

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game implemented using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game allows two players to play on the same device, taking turns to mark "X" and "O" on a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks horizontally, vertically, or diagonally wins the game.

Player vs Player: Two players can take turns playing the game on a single device.
Responsive Design: The game board adjusts to different screen sizes.
Interactive UI: Click to mark cells with "X" or "O" and visually see the game progress.
Game Reset: Once a player wins or the game ends in a draw, the game can be restarted.

**Technologies Used**

HTML: Structure of the webpage and game board.
CSS: Styling of the game board, buttons, and other elements.
JavaScript: Game logic for handling player moves, win conditions, and game resets.

**How to Play**

The game board consists of 9 empty cells arranged in a 3x3 grid.
Player 1 (X) starts by clicking an empty cell.
Player 2 (O) takes their turn by clicking another empty cell.
Players continue alternating turns until one player wins by aligning three marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally), or the game ends in a draw if all cells are filled without a winner.
After the game ends, click the "Reset Game" button to start a new game.
